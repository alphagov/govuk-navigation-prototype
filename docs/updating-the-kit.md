# Updating the kit

**Important note**

If you have made any changes outside the `app` folder, this process will destroy those changes. We will try and improve the update process to avoid this, but in the meantime you will need to make a note of your changes outside `app`, and add them back after updating.

## Steps

Download the latest prototype kit zip file from GitHub

In your project, delete everything apart from the `app` and `.git` folder

Copy everything from the latest kit to your project, apart from the `app` folder
