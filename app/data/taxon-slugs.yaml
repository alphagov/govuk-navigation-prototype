# Hardcoded list of taxons to make available in the prototype. See
# https://collections-publisher.publishing.service.gov.uk/taxons for a complete
# list of every taxon in the content store. The list below could probably be
# fetched dynamically but for now its useful to explicitly declare the taxons -
# its helpful when testing changes to limit the retrieval to a subset.
